### High-level SME Demo Summary

In order to most efficiently operate our factories, we need to be able to accurately 
orecast what parts are going to be needed in the future. To do this, we rely on previous 
data in order to create models that accurately estimate how many of each component may be 
needed in the next week. This way factories can tweak their production accordingly and not
run either a part shortage or surplus. We will focus on one specific part, the vehicle motors.
